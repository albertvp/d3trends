# GOALS

The main goal of this tech test is to create a client side web application that reproduces the screenshot above.

We will only evaluate the client side code and the criteria will be based mainly on:

* Clean, maintainable, easy­to­read and unit tested code

* Good architectural practices

* Clean HTML and CSS markup

# STRONG CONSIDERATIONS

* We encourage the usage of D3JS library

* Avoid using external frameworks like jQuery, AngularJS or React JS.

* Load the data model in the format that best suits your needs.

* Avoid any backend development / dependency. If you think you need to load external data mock it.

* The trend figure inside the circle is not your main mission, it will be a cherry on top of the pie.

# TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

* We think using RequireJS and Jasmine as part of the solution would also help.

## THINGS TO EVALUATE

* Produce a reusable component (View) connected to 3 different data models.

* There’s a clear MVC separation of concerns.

* Pixel accuracy reproducing designs

* Good use of libraries

* Good use of pure Javascript language.

# NOT REQUIRED, BUT IMPRESSIVE

­ It would be nice if the three figures are inside an animated carrousel­like (or gallery) component, so the user can navigate through them horizontally. This carrousel should run completely smooth, especially in a mobile device.
